Welcome to our new lab website. Where you can learn more about our research and lab-life.  

Ella made this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, a Ruby based site jenerator that supports Markdown. It allows straightforward and quick updates, including images and code snippets, by all lab members. The site is hosted by Github-Pages, so a push is an update, and all pictures and gifs are on Imgur. 

You can find the source code to the website on our lab's [Github](https://github.com/PreibischLab){:target="_blank"}.
