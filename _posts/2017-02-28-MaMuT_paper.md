New publication on cell tracking using multiview reconstructions of lightsheet microscopy images.

We contributed to a new publication tracking cell lineages in developing Parhyale hawaiensis embryos using reconstructed multiview lightsheet microscopy data:

The results of the tracking are illustrated by figure 1 and 2 of the preprint:

***Fig 1**: Reconstruction of Parhyale embryogenesis from multi-view LSFM*  
<small>*(A) Transgenic Parhyale embryos with H2B-mRFPruby labeled nuclei were mounted in agarose with scattered red fluorescent beads (green dots) as fiducial markers for multi- view reconstruction. Each embryo was imaged from the indicated 5 views with a 45 ̊ rotation around the anterior-posterior body axis between neighboring views. Each panel shows a 3D rendering of the corresponding view with anterior towards the left. (B) Input views were registered and fused computationally into a single output image rendered here in different positions around the dorsal-ventral axis. (C-K) Each panel shows a 3D rendering of the fused volume at the indicated developmental stage in hours (h) after egg- lay (AEL) and the corresponding time-point (TP) of the recording. Abbreviations: first antenna (An1), second antenna (An2), mandible (Mn), maxilla 1 (Mx1), maxilla 2 (Mx2), thoracic appendages 1 to 8 (T1-T8), pleonic (abdominal) appendages 1 to 6 (P1-P6) and telson (Te) at the posterior terminus of the body. Color masks are used to indicate the cells contributing to the developing Mx2 (in blue), T1 maxilliped (in green), T2 and T3 gnathopods (in light and dark yellow, respectively) and T4 limb (in magenta). (C) Embryo at mid-germband stage (S13 according to (Browne et al., 2005)). The ventral midline is denoted with the dotted line. (D) Embryo at stage S15. Germband has extended to the posterior egg pole and the first antennal bud is visible anteriorly. (E) Embryo at stage S18 with posterior ventral flexure. Head and thoracic appendages have bulged out up to T4. (F) Embryo at stage S19 with prominent head and thoracic appendage buds up to T6. (G) Embryo at stage S20 continues elongating ventrally and anteriorly. Appendage buds are also visible in the pleon up to P3. (H) Embryo at stage S21. Segmentation is complete and all appendages have formed. The Mx2 has split into two branches (blue arrowheads) and the T1 maxilliped has developed two proximal ventral outgrowths (green arrowheads). (I) Embryo at stage S22, (J) stage S23, and (K) stage S24 showing different stages of appendage segmentation. Dorsal outgrowths at the base of thoracic appendages, namely coxal plates (orange arrowheads) and gills (red arrowheads), are indicated in T2, T3 and T4. In all panels anterior is towards the left and dorsal towards the top. Scale bars are 100 μm.*</small>

<small>*(A-A’’) 3D rendering of Parhyale embryo at the growing germband stage, (A) Right side, (A’) ventral side, and (A’’) left side. Color masks indicate the anterior head region (blue), the bilaterally symmetric midgut precursors (green), the orderly arranged parasegments E1 to E10 (in alternating cyan and magenta), the posterior end of the germband (blue) with ongoing organization of cells into new rows, and the extraembryonic tissue (white). (B-D) Ventral views of elongating germband at the indicated hours (h) after egg-lay (AEL). Ectodermal cells making up the E8 parasegment are shown in magenta. (B’) Schematic of tracked E8 abcd cells (blue) at the 1-row- parasegment, (C’) anterior ab cells (orange) and posterior cd cells (red) after the first longitudinally-oriented division at the 2-row-parasegment, and (D’) a cells (cyan), b cells (yellow), c cells (green) and d cells (magenta) after the second longitudinally-oriented division at the 4-row-parasegment. Both mitotic waves proceed in medial to lateral direction. The resulting daughter cells sort in clearly defined columns. In each hemisegment, ascending numbers indicate column position relative to the ventral midline (column 0).
