Today we concluded the "EU-Life Course: Biological Image Reconstruction and Analysis".

It was an exciting week teaching the 1st EU-Life Course "Biological Image Reconstruction and Analysis". We want to thank all the presenters and students for contributing. A nice summary of events can be found on Twitter using the hashtag [#BioImgBerlin](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BioImgBerlin&src=typd){:target="_blank"}.
