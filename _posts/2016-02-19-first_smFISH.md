The first single molecule FISH images of *C. elegans* are produced in the lab by Laura.

Today [Laura Breimann](https://preibischlab.github.io/preibisch-labsite/members/#laura) successfully produced the first *C. elegans* smFISH images of the Preibisch lab. Single-molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization is a technology that allows to visualize individual mRNA molecules in cells, or in this case even in entire *C. elegans* embryos!
