Klim just came back from the [Hackathon](http://imagej.net/2016-12-20_-_Fiji_%2B_KNIP_hackathon){:target="_blank"} in Dresden.

20 coders invested their time in two weeks of insane coding sessions followed by the social events. 

During the Hackathon Klim pushed forward the development of the Fiji plugin for the calculation of radial symmetry centers and picked up some tricks for cell-tracking using [MaMuT](http://imagej.net/MaMuT){:target="_blank"}.
