Klim just cam back for the [Hackathon](http://imagej.net/2016-12-20_-_Fiji_%2B_KNIP_hackathon){:target="_blank"} in Dresden.

20 coders invested their time in two weeks of insane afternoon coding sessions followed by the social events. 

During the Hackathon Klim pushed forward the Fiji plugin development for the calculation of radial symmetry centers and picked up some tricks for tracking using [MaMuT](http://imagej.net/MaMuT){:target="_blank"}.
