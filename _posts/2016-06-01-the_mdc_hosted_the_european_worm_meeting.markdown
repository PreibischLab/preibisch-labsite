We all attanded the super duper cool talks, learned so much exciting stuff about that kickass tiny worm that we simply then and there vowed to dedicate our lives to it.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
int i=5;
for (int j=5; j<10; j++) {
	i=j;
}
{% endhighlight %}
