November 14-18th we are organizing the EU-Life Course: "Biological Image Reconstruction and Analysis".

The course will cover fundamental topics in image analysis and thier application in biological systems. There will be theoretical lectures followed by tutorials where students directly apply what they have learned. The work will be performed in Fiji, Matlab, and KNIME. The course will be beneficial to PhD students and postdocs, experimental biologists and computer scientists, who are seeking a better understanding of advanced methods in image analysis and thier applications to biological systems.
