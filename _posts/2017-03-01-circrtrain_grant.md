**The circRTrain H2020 Grant was funded, looking for motivated PhD students!**

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large, newly discovered class of non-coding RNAs [1]. Due to their specific circular structure they display unusually high stability and can just recently be detected using new sequencing and computational technologies. Characterizing function of circRNAs has recently spiked very high interest in many fields including basic molecular biology, neurobiology, neurodegenerative diseases, aging, cancer, and biomarker research.

As a member of the [circRTrain](https://circrtrain.eu){:target="_blank"}, which is a Marie Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN) funded by the European Union within the H2020 Programme, we are seeking highly motivated PhD students to join the Preibisch Lab.
