### Stephan Preibisch, PhD

#### Principal Investigator

Stephan Preibisch received his master of computer science from the Technical University of Dresden in 2006. During his studies he was working at the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics in Leipzig developing the 'Hook'-algorithm for the correction of microarray data. He did his PhD at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics in Dresden where he designed solutions for the reconstruction of lightsheet microscopy data and the image processing library ImgLib2, which is now part of Fiji and ImageJ2. During his time as bioinformatics specialist at HHMI Janelia (Ashburn, USA) and HFSP fellow at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (New York) and MPI-CBG (Dresden, Germany) he was developing a complete computational representation of C. elegans dauer exit using a combination of experimental and computational methods. The Preibisch laboratory at the Berlin Institute of Medical Systems Biology of the Max Delbrück Center is now focused on lightsheet microscopy, single-molecule RNA imaging, and image processing, studying the regulation of developmental processes in C. elegans.

### Varun Kapoor, PhD

#### Postdoc

Varun graduated from Panjab University in India specializing in physics and mathematics. He continued his postgraduate studies in theoretical physics at IMSc, India and the University of Manchester, UK with specialization in Quantum Chromodynamics. In his doctoral studies at the University of Rostock, he focused on obtaining atomic dynamics by solving respective PDE's and then moved to MPI in Göttingen focusing on multi-electron systems and biostatistics. Currently he is interested in developing generic algorithms and implementing them in a user-friendly interface to be used as general purpose tools for bio-physical applications.

### Dhana Friedrich

#### Collaborating PhD Student

Dhana did her Bachelors in Molecular Life Sciences at the University of Hamburg. Afterwards she graduated with a Diploma in Biochemistry at the Freie Universität Berlin. She did her Diploma thesis at the MDC Berlin, working on p53 signaling dynamics in cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Since 2014 she is working on her phd project at the MDC and the IRI for the Life Sciences (Humboldt University Berlin) to understand the correlation between oscillatory transcription factors and stochastic gene expression, supervised by Alexander Loewer. To address her scientific aims, she is closely collaborating with the Preibisch lab as well as the research groups of Andreas Herrmann (HU) and Amit Meller (Technion, Israel).
